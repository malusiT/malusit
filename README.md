I'm a **software developer transitioning from frontend to backend development**. After building several web projects, I discovered my passion lies in **server-side logic, APIs, and problem-solving** rather than design. Currently deep-diving into **Java and Spring Boot** to build robust backend systems.

## 💡 My Journey

I started in web development building frontend projects, but realized my strengths and interests lie in **backend logic rather than UI/UX design**. I'm more excited solving algorithmic problems and building robust systems than making things look pretty.

I'm pivoting to backend development where I can focus on:
- API design and architecture
- Database modeling and optimization  
- Business logic and problem-solving
- System integration

My frontend experience is valuable for understanding how APIs are consumed and building full-stack projects when needed.
